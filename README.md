# KeyboardAvoidingAndDismissingView

This component wraps `KeyboardAvoidingView` in a `TouchableWithoutFeedback` that
only gets enabled when the keyboard is shown.

It takes the same props as the [KeyboardAvoidingView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/keyboardavoidingview.html).

It sets some default props:
```
style={{ flex: 1}}
behavior="padding"
```
